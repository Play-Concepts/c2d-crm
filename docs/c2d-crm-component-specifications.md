## About the c2d CRM Component

### Etymology

`c2d`is the abbreviation of `Centralised to Decentralised`.

### Overview

Many current businesses have legacy data of their customers in proprietary formats. Some even have them in desktop spreadsheets such as Excel or CSV files.

In the process of modernising their businesses and bringing them to the forefront of the digital economy, a new method of handling their customer data is required. It is now paramount to addressing the increasing privacy concerns of customers and to comply with modern privacy regulations such as the GDPR and CCPA.

One way to deal with such requirements is to return the data to the customer, and transfer maintenance and ownership of the data to the customer himself.

The above is not unique to commercial entities along. Government bodies such as the City of Elyria, are also looking to return citizenry data to its constituents. The aim of this project is to build a tool that allows the City of Elyria to do just that.

### Stakeholders

### Purpose

The main purpose of the `c2d` project is to provide an avenue for the business/government entity to transfer its legacy customer data to its individual customers.

### Considerations and Assumptions

When designing this project, several factors are taken into consideration

Although the first beneficiary of this project is the City of Elyria, the output of this `c2d` project should **easily be replicated and customised** for another similar entity.

As such, it is assumed that the potential customer has **existing access control systems** that `c2d`must **integrate** with.

It is also assumed that the **CSV file format** is the lowest common denominator. Whatever legacy data formats employed by the customer, it is possible to export the relevant data out in CSV format.

### User Journey

1. Using the **Admin Dashboard**, the Business **uploads a CSV** containing customer information that is to be transferred back to the Customer
2. The uploaded data is saved in a holding **database**.
3. The Customer **signs in** to the **Identity Passport** with his PDA. If he does not have one, a PDA will be created for him.
4. The **Identity Passport** brings the Customer to the **Claim-Your-Data** page.
5. The Customer **searches** for himself on the page. If found, a **confirmation prompt** is shown.
6. On clicking **OK** on the confirmation prompt, the data will be written to the Customer's PDA. The corresponding record on the holding database will be **deleted**.
7. The Customer is returned to the Identity Passport.

### Project Scope

1. Web based Admin Dashboard for the Business
2. Web based Claim Your Data page for the Customer
3. supporting Data Service REST APIs
4. Integrate with Identity Passport



## Features

### REST API

There are 4 main API endpoints to handle the following functions

- [ ] 1. to receive an uploaded CSV file containing Customer information and

  - [ ] transform it according to predefined rule-set
    - [ ] the transformation rule-set in defined in a configuration file as part of the deployment package
  - [ ] store the transformed data in a database

- [ ] 2. to allow the Business view the uploaded data (both claimed and unclaimed)

- [ ] 3. to allow the Customer to claim his data

  - [ ] on claiming the data, it would then be deleted from the database
  - [ ] on claiming that data, the data would be written into his PDA
    - [ ] the format of the data that's written into his PDA is the exact format as defined in the transformation rule-set   above
  - [ ] 4. as a dependency, there would also be an API to allow the customer to search for his user data, so as to claim it

### Customer's Claim-Your-Data Page

This is a Web interface that allows the Customer to call the relevant REST API

- [ ] to search for his own entry in the database
- [ ] to claim that entry as his own

### Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard is used by the Business and comprises of

- [ ] a page to upload a CSV file and send it to the appropriate API endpoint for processing
- [ ] a page to view
  - [ ] data that has been uploaded
  - [ ] data that has been claimed
